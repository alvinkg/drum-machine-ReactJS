# Drum Machine with React JS

This is a drum machine that I built referencing a youtube video by [Landon Schlangen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTTaO1IjjlM).  Instead of javascript he used the React framework and added two features, recording and speed of the playback.
However, I am not able yet to employ the recording as it interferes with the audio for some reason.  Even after I tried to add a function to provide some separation.  Somehow using a setState does not work well.
With React 18 we need to change the way we render in ReactDOM.
